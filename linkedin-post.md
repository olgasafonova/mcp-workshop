## Option A: The Hook

AI that knows everything but does nothing is just an expensive search bar.

I built 4 MCP servers in December. By the end, I had AI creating Miro boards, updating roadmaps, and controlling my browser.

Now I'm running a workshop to share what I learned.

**MCP Workshop: From Explorer to Builder**

Hosted by Women in Product Nordics & TechWomen Copenhagen

What you'll learn:
- What MCP actually is (and why it matters)
- How to set up your first server in 10 minutes
- Production patterns from real implementations

No coding required for the first two tiers. Developers get architecture deep-dives in tier three.

1 hour. All levels. Hands-on demos.

## Option B: The Story

Medieval scribes spent years copying manuscripts by hand. They knew everything in those texts. But they couldn't change a word without starting over.

That's what AI was until MCP.

Model Context Protocol lets AI take action, not just answer questions. Create diagrams. Update documents. Control your browser.

I'm running a workshop on it with Women in Product Nordics & TechWomen Copenhagen.

Three tiers:
- Explorer: What are MCPs (no tech background needed)
- User: How to set one up
- Builder: How to create your own

I'll show live demos with real servers I built: Miro, MediaWiki, GLEIF, Playwright.

Comment "MCP" for the event link.

## Option C: Direct

I'm leading an MCP workshop for Women in Product Nordics & TechWomen Copenhagen.

MCP = Model Context Protocol. It's the standard that lets AI assistants take action in your apps.

The workshop covers three levels:

**Explorer** (15 min)
What MCPs are. RAG vs MCP. Why this changes everything.

**User** (17 min)
Setup demo. Cloud vs local apps. Effective prompting.

**Builder** (17 min)
Architecture patterns. Production code. Getting started.

Live demos with Miro, browser automation, and API integrations.

1 hour. No prerequisites for the first two tiers.
