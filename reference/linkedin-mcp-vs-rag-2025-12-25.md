"Can you make AI do [thing] for me?"

I keep getting this question. The answer used to be "it depends." Now it's usually "yeah, if there's an MCP server for that."

I've built 3 this year: ProductPlan, our wiki, Miro. Each time I thought I was just solving my own annoying problem.

MCP joined the Linux Foundation this month. The big players are all in. It's becoming standard infrastructure.

Here's what most teams miss: they're deep into RAG, but RAG is only one layer of the AI action stack. It retrieves. It can't actually do anything.

MCP is the missing layer. It lets AI take action. Click buttons. Create things. Move stuff around.

You need both eventually. But an AI that knows everything and does nothing? That's just a very expensive search bar.

**Notes:**
- Angle: AI Action Stack framing + MCP vs RAG comparison + personal build experience
- Context: Schedule after Miro MCP server post goes live and engagement is measured
- Carousel: 9-slide John Maeda style (mcp-vs-rag-carousel.pdf)
