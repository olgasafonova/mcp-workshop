## Post Copy


I built 4 MCP servers in December. Then one big company CEO reached out to say thanks, as I apparently was ahead of their official MCP. Colleagues started using my wiki server daily.

That's when I knew I had to share this more widely. MCP changes how we work with AI. And everyone can benefit, not just developers.

So I'm hosting a workshop with Women in Product and Tech Women Copenhagen.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the difference between AI that answers questions and AI that takes action. Creates Miro boards. Updates wikis. Controls your browser. Manages roadmaps.

The workshop takes you through three stages:

**Explorer** → "What can it do?"
Curious. Watching demos. Seeing possibilities.

**Practitioner** → "What can it do for me?"
Using daily. Getting value. Prompting with intent.

**Architect** → "What can I make it do?"
Designing systems. Building servers. Enabling others.

Live demos with servers I actually built: Miro (77 tools), MediaWiki, ProductPlan, GLEIF. Plus browser automation with Playwright.

One hour. All skill levels. Real tools, not slides.

It's on February 5th at 16.30. Mark your calendars - the official invite and more details are coming!

## Event Form Submission

**Host:** Olga Safonova

**Date:** [TBD - at least 3 weeks out]

**Event Heading/Topic:** MCP Workshop

**Event slogan/subheading:** From Explorer to Architect

**Description (156 words):**

Most AI tools answer questions. MCP makes them take action.

Model Context Protocol connects AI assistants to the apps you use daily. Your AI can create Miro boards, update wiki pages, manage roadmaps, and control your browser directly.

This workshop has three stages:

Explorer – See what's possible. Live demos showing AI that acts, not just answers. No technical background needed.

Practitioner – Get hands-on. Configure Claude Desktop with MCP servers and start using them in your daily workflow.

Architect – Build your own. Learn the patterns from four production MCP servers I built in December 2024: Miro (77 tools), MediaWiki, ProductPlan, and GLEIF.

You'll see both cloud integrations (APIs like Miro and GLEIF) and local tools (browser automation, filesystem access). Whether you want to understand the hype, become a power user, or build servers yourself, this workshop is for you.

One hour. All skill levels welcome.
